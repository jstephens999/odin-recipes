    <h2>Amazing Street Tacos</h2>
    <p>Easy and tasty street taco recipe passed down in my family for generations. 
        Street tacos are delicious, amazing, and oh so mouthwatering! Bite into tender 
        steak, zesty lime flavor with a hint of spice and add on tomatoes, avocado, and 
        onions for a savory bite you are going to love! These street tacos are completely 
        jam-packed with flavor and they are so easy to make. I love how the meat is so 
        tender and juicy and only takes an hour to marinate!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Flank steak or skirt steak: Preparation of the steak is key to this dish.</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce: This will be your friend on this steak. 
            It brings the marinade together.</li>
        <li>Lime: You can use lime juice from a fresh lime or any juice that you may 
            already have on hand (about 2 Tablespoons).</li>
        <li>Minced garlic: If you aren’t using fresh garlic cloves, you can use the 
            minced garlic you already have (½ tsp usually equals 1 clove of garlic).</li>
        <li>Cilantro: This garnish is optional, but if you choose not to use it, God
            help your soul.</li>
        <li>Chili powder: This will give you a little bit of spice without too much heat.</li>
        <li>Cumin: Cumin adds in an interesting flavor, don’t forget this spice!</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Add this in to your preferred taste.</li>
        <li>Flour or corn tortillas: Make sure that you are using the smaller tortillas 
            (not burrito size).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut and mix: Cut the flank steak into one inch pieces. In a medium sized bowl 
            add the soy sauce, Worcestershire, juice from one lime, cilantro, chili powder, cumin, and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Marinate: Add the steak and let marinate in the fridge for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Cook the meat: Heat a medium sized skillet to medium high heat. Add the steak and marinade and cook for about 5-7 
            minutes or until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Put the steak in the center of your tortilla with desired toppings.</li>    
        </ol>
