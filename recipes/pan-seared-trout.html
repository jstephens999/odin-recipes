    <h2>Delicious Pan Seared Trout</h2>
    <p>Trout is a delicate and mild-tasting fish that most people enjoy. And because trout 
        fillets are thin, you can season them and throw them in a skillet to cook in a little 
        extra virgin olive oil.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp all-natural garlic powder (or 1 to 2 teaspoon garlic paste)</li>
        <li>1 ½ lb trout fillet (or butterflied trout fillet as in the pictures)</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour for coating (no more than ½ cup)</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil (I used Private Reserve Greek EVOO)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Add this in to your preferred taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the coriander, paprika, and garlic powder in a small mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat the trout fillet dry. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper on both sides, then season with the spices on both sides.</li>
        <li>Coat the seasoned fish with the flour, shake off any excess flour (you only want a very thin layer).</li>
        <li>In a large cast iron skillet, heat about 3 to 4 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking (see note). Sear the trout fillets for 3 minutes on each side (start with skin-side down, and use a spatula to very carefully flip the fish fillets over).</li>  
        <li>Remove the fish from the pan and place it on a tray lined with paper towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving platter and finish with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.</li>
        </ol>
